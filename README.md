# Boston Marathon Analysis (2015, 2016, 2017)

## Summary
I love to run, so I wanted to use my skills on a dataset related to running. Luckily, I came across this dataset from Kaggle.com.
I really enjoyed exploring and transforming this data. I have never ran a marathon, let alone a half marathon, so it was interesting and fun to see how paces and times changed throughout the entirety of the Boston Marathon.
I explored the 2015 dataset, then I trained Random Forest and KNN to predict race time and age (for all 3 years), and then I looked more closely at the top racers from all 3 years.
This project mainly demonstrates exploratory data analysis and is a cool intro into looking at running data.
In the future, I want to try to work with training running data (either from Garmin or Strava) and try to build more advanced visuals (heat maps, graphic images, etc.).
