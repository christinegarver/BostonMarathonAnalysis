# Boston Marathon Analysis (2015, 2016, 2017)

## Summary
I love to run, so I wanted to use my skills on a dataset related to running. Luckily, I came across this dataset from Kaggle.com.
I really enjoyed exploring and transforming this data. I have never ran a marathon, let alone a half marathon, so it was interesting and fun to see how paces and times changed throughout the entirety of the Boston Marathon.
I explored the 2015 dataset, and then I trained Random Forest and KNN to predict race time and age (for all 3 years).
