# Boston Marathon Analysis (2015, 2016, 2017)

## Summary
I love to run, so I wanted to use my skills on a dataset related to running. Luckily, I came across this dataset from Kaggle.com.
I really enjoyed exploring and transforming this data. I have never ran a marathon, let alone a half marathon, so it was interesting and fun to see how paces and times changed throughout the entirety of the Boston Marathon.
I explored the 2015 dataset, top racers across all 3 years, and then I trained Random Forest and KNN models to predict race time and age (for all 3 years). The results weren't great, but I expected this because we did not have many features and we only had 3 years worth of data.
This project mainly demonstrates exploratory data analysis and is a cool intro of using EDA and modeling to look at running data.
In the future, I want to try to work with training running data (either from Garmin or Strava) and try to build more advanced visuals (heat maps, graphic images, etc.).

Thank You!!

## How to Run the Notebook
Open the notebook using jupyter notebook and run through each cell. I have bits of Markdown in the notebook that explain my thinking and reasoning (this is usually the most important part of working with data because there are so many different ways to ask questions and approach problems!). Just run each cell in order (you may need to install some libraries). Please let me know if I messed up, need to fix anything, or you have any questions!

## TLDR (my code): Running is fun --> if you train hard and are disciplined, you can get awesome times!!
